        <h2 class="text-3xl font-mono font-bold text-red-500 text-opacity-70">Question : What is difference between map,
            filter, forEach and find ?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-sans font-semibold text-opacity-80 text-gray-900"><span

                :</span>
            <br>
            forEach is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the
            array and it returns undefined.
            <br>
            map executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
            <br>
            filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
            with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
            <br>
            find method in Javascript is used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the
            provided condition.

            between Local storage, Session storage and Cookies ?</h2>

                class="text-3xl mt-4 text-sky-700">Answer :</span>
            <br>
            Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
            <br>
            Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.
            <br>
            Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session
            IDs.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-mono font-bold text-red-500 text-opacity-70 mt-10">Question : What is event loop? How
            does it work ?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-sans font-semibold text-opacity-80 text-gray-900"><span
                class="text-3xl mt-4 text-sky-700">Answer :</span>
            <br>
            JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
            collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
            <br>
            The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task
            Queue to the Call Stack.
